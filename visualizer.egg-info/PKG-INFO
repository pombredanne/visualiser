Description: visualizer is a set of tools for visualizing software quality. I have been working exclusively on testing software for over five years now. During this time I was constantly reimplementing tools for visualizing test results like for example logfile parsing. I was using different open source packages for visualization because my taste for software libraries was evolving over time.
        
        During the 2009 I wanted to evolve the visualization tool-set again and I evaluated some tools like Matplotlib, R, Processing, John Resig's Processing.js, and TheJit. I read some books about Statistics and Graphics. At one stage I found myself rethinking my approach to visualization altogether. Meanwhile I read through a bunch of books and hundreds of papers, PhD thesis, and websites on information visualization. In January 2010 I went to Dallas for a tutorial on 'Presenting data and information' by Professor Edward Tufte. With his inspiration I was be able to work out a more effective approach to visualization of software quality. At about that time I started working on the visualizer project.
        
        I presented the visualizer prototype at the EuroPython 2010 conference and I am working since then on further improvements. I am looking forward to release a first version soon.
        
        Currently I try to provide support on a best effort basis. You should address the discussion forum in case you have questions, bug reports, feature requests, etc.:
